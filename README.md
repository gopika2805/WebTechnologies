This project focuses on creating an interactive image map using HTML, tailored for a hardware application. It allows users to visually explore and interact with different components of a hardware system. The image map is responsive, customizable, and designed to work seamlessly across modern browsers. By highlighting specific regions of the hardware image, users can access detailed information or control certain functions, making it an intuitive tool for understanding and navigating complex hardware layouts.
